EMERGENCY ROLLBACK - 2026-02-23 15:55 UTC

Rolled back from: a0de534 (fix: conditionally run prisma db push in build only when DATABASE_URL is available)
Rolled back to: b04836a (fix: normalize null category descriptions in version config loader)

Reason: 4 failed deployments in 4 minutes with persistent 500 errors on /quiz endpoint.
The commits after b04836a were all attempts to fix database/Prisma issues that were either:
1. Introduced by the auth bypass feature (1ebbed3), or
2. Exposed by that feature

The fix attempts created a "fix loop" where each commit tried to solve problems from the previous one.
Rolling back to the last known-good state to restore production stability.

After rollback, investigate:
- Why did the auth bypass feature (1ebbed3) break /quiz?
- Is the database schema out of sync?
- Are runtime Prisma connections failing?

Next steps: Redeploy from this known-good commit, then carefully analyze root cause.
